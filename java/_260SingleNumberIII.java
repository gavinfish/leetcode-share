/**
 * Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].
 * 
 * Note:
 * The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
 * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
